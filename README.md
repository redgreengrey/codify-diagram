This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run npm install to setup dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can run this app locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can go to https://codify-diagram.vercel.app/ and check it online

## P.S.

On Windows it looks ok, but on mac i don't see font, Naturally, there is no adaptive option,
but it is not in the technical specifications, but for some reason there are fonts on the iPhone in Safari. I haven't done this yet
